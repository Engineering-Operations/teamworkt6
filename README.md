delete redundant branch
pipeline integration CI
Blockers:The Blockers I faced were:
  As I am still getting used to VS Code I attempted to push the changes made to the Jenkins File to github but unnawaringly the changes I made to the code were not being saved therefore when I would push the file the second stage would not appear. I resolved This blocker by going to the File tab and checking the auto save button so that my changes were being saved real time.
